# Staff Removal {#staff-removal}

A grounds for a staff removal is a personal and/or a communal event. This is the final answer to  a really negative social capital a staffer has in the community. A staffer is expected to abide and use this guideline as their process on how to interact and become a contributing member of the community.

Anyone can ask anyone to relinquish their role as staff. This is a very expensive act â€“ in terms of social capital. It is subjected to our conflict resolution guidelines (see below), which it will be first driven by conversation, and if that erodes can also be called to a vote by the staffers, or the community at large.
