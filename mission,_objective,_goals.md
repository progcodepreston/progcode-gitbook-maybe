# Mission, Objective, Goals {#mission-objective-goals}

We are organized around providing a framework of support to a network of technologists aiming for progressive change.

The primary mission of the Progressive Coders Network is to create and facilitate a framework of support for applications that will create a more progressive society through technology. As we have had a glimpse during the last primary, coders were able to create awesome open source tools to drive progressive change. We want to continue with that mission.

The core objective of Progressive Coders Network is for the need of its own existence to become obsolete. If our mission is accomplished, and have created a network of technologists and have created a society that is equitable and just, we will have achieved that mission and will thus have no longer reason to exist. It is with this objective that we center all our energies in working towards a more progressive society with a very empowered grassroots movement through the help of technology.

However, right now, that is not the case. There is a need for ProgCode to exist. For ProgCode to become successful (and thus become obsolete itself), there must no longer be the influence of big money in politics and fully empower the grassroots â€“ because of the FOSS/low-cost tools we have helped build. We will render ourselves obsolete if we are able to build a technological culture that provides a ready support arm for the progressive movement.

If we have stopped existing before this goal is met, we have failed the core mission. If we have changed our views and do not want to become obsolete any longer, we will have failed the core objective.
