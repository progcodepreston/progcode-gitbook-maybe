# Agenda {#agenda}

As a framework of support, we have no agenda other than providing support to the applications within the network and providing a service that will lead to the success of the projects and organizations that have chosen to be part of our network. Their success is our success, and the success of the progressive tech movement as a whole.

Any ulterior agenda – self-promotion, self-branding – is not part of our service as it provides the impetus for the organization to exist because of itself (something that the core objective is in complete opposition to). The idea is that these projects chose to stay with us and they are free to leave us whenever they want. However, if they choose to stay with us, it is in our best interest – our agenda – to make it as worthwhile as possible, with only their success at heart.

To put it succinctly, the only agenda we have is the fact that these projects can and will remove the influence of big money in politics, and fully empower the progressive grassroots movement. As such, it is in our interest to provide service to the applications in the network.
