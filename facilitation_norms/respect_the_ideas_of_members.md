## Respect the ideas of members {#respect-the-ideas-of-members}

Ideation is such an integral part of Progressive Coders Network that the mere act of creating and building an idea to the community becomes a form of taking ownership to the community as a whole. We must respect these ideas and allow it to bloom or to reach its natural demise without negativity and with respect.
