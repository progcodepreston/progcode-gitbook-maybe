## Key items in every project {#key-items-in-every-project}

The following are important aspects any project in the community has got to have in order to drive development into their respective projects. ProgCode staffers can facilitate any of these if requested or has the go signal of the app creator.

### Project Channel {#project-channel}

The main venue and meeting point for partners to join the conversation and discuss the project goals, and the problem it is trying to solve. Again, the mere act of entry to a channel is – in itself – an act of putting stake into a project. Discussion deepens this idea and if driven well enough, will develop into ownership. Conversation is a key aspect in the whole process and having an area for which this is possible will be helpful.

The creation of a channel is also the first act of ownership the app creator does for the community. The mere act of creating a channel is central to starting a conversation between the creator and the community.

This will also allow us to drive members and partners into the project.

### Documentation {#documentation}

A clear and concise definition of the problem is necessary for a clean and sustainable onboarding and re-onboarding process. It will provide a fuller context of what the project is about, making it easier for members to jump on board the idea and contribute further. This opens up a great conversation about the nature of the problem, and allows the deepening of the members’ sense of ownership toward the project.

To be clear, any form or act of engagement towards a specific project can be considered as an act of putting stake onto the project. Any interaction one initiates to a project provides ways for a member to build a sense of ownership, so the more avenues and the more ways a person can interact with a project, the better and faster it is to cultivate ownership and acts of collaboration.

### Facilitation / Interaction {#facilitation-interaction}

New members of a channel ought to have someone who is dedicated to welcoming them and guiding them through the process of getting onboarded to the project. It is hard to join a project when no one is talking to you, and there is no further development of ownership if right after you have joined a project no one bothers to interact with the newcomer. So facilitation / introduction / interaction are key to creating a very sustainable relationship with members.
