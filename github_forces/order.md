## Order {#order}

The main purpose of GitHub is to make sense of everything that is happening in the ProgCode slack. To bring order to the chaos that Slack has presented. As such, we bring forth important information / updates from Slack to Github, to make the onboarding and even re-onboarding process as smoothly as possible.
