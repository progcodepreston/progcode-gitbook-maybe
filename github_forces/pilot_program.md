## Pilot Program {#pilot-program}

In order to cultivate the push-pull culture, we have created the [Pilot Program](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.bit.ly/progcode-pilots&sa=D&ust=1485764357499000&usg=AFQjCNEQ73VjtC1oh65zJp1Fy4l2sWn6hg) to facilitate all the efforts being done for the good of the community. Anyone can add on to the pilot program, and itâ€™s divided according to functions. It is public as well, in order to provide transparency and allow people to see all the things that we are doing within and outside of slack.

We have repurposed the Github Projects mechanism to visualize all the efforts happening within the network, all of which grouped by functions.
