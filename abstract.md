# Abstract {#abstract}

The Progressive Coders Network is – as the name says – a network. And for one to understand how to be part of the ProgCode staff, one must fully understand the dynamics and forces surrounding networks.

This document lays out research-driven best practices within networks as well as acquired knowledge throughout the formation of ProgCode.

The organization of this document is as follows:

Core Objectives

 describe the reason of our existence and our mission. We also discuss the Agenda and [Values](values/README.md) that drive the culture of the community. After that, we will talk about the [Ego Check](ego_check/README.md), something that staffers have to continuously be mindful about as we move forward and interact with the community. Slack Forces and [Facilitation Norms](facilitation_norms/README.md) cover the basics on how we use slack, and how slack coincides with the culture we are forming. [Github Forces](github_forces/README.md) will provide us with an overlook on how we try to make sense of the chaos from Slack. And finally – the

Parts of the House

 – a discussion on the parts that make up the #operations channel.

You will be exposed to the dynamics we have with various entities in the network. As an entity ourselves, ProgCode can be considered one of the applications in the network, with the key goal         of becoming conduits of collaboration between these applications.

For a deeper dive on what a network is all about, I strongly urge you to read [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/networks-book/&sa=D&ust=1485764357442000&usg=AFQjCNH6JEnFp47ylh8Rlay-U0_TvU8wrw) (highly recommend), [Mark Granovetter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.unc.edu/~fbaum/teaching/articles/Lohmann_WP_1994.pdf&sa=D&ust=1485764357443000&usg=AFQjCNGvaNcB4lMlV5m-mdkWx3dONqo6kw), and [Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.com/Tipping-Point-Little-Things-Difference/dp/0316346624&sa=D&ust=1485764357443000&usg=AFQjCNFWHg4FaR3Gt9KysowL7CYFd0aqqw). Furthermore, resources by Robert Putnam and [Jane Franklin](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lsbu.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/9439/women-social-capital-families-research-working-paper.pdf&sa=D&ust=1485764357444000&usg=AFQjCNFCditbGUrj9hcgbHwhRvUTpusJOw) provides a deeper understanding on [social capital](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital&sa=D&ust=1485764357445000&usg=AFQjCNFi9myMgDvLHiD9O1nLmEE_O4zw5Q), a network force/currency that we are trying to maximize and leverage inside and outside the network.

For further info, @joepbreslin (operations coordinator) and I (@rapi) are more than happy to go on one-on-ones and learn more about your thoughts and ideas.

This document will be ratified by the community on Monday, Jan 30, 2017 and will be the source of truth on anything related to staffers.
