## Partner Dynamics {#partner-dynamics}

At the moment, Rapi drives the partnerships both from the application creators and external networks standpoint.

For app creators, the process starts by reaching out to partners and finding a time to talk. Rapi will usually call for someone to join him in the call so that the joiner will then become the point person who will help out the app creator. The coordinator will be responsible in making sure the ProgCode staff knows what the app creator currently needs. Coordinators have to make sure that they are coming from a place of service.
