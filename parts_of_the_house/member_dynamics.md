## Member Dynamics {#member-dynamics}

The lifecycle of a progressive coder starts and ends as a lurker. We fully accept that 80% of the community will not be interactive at all, and that 20% of the total population will be doing 80% of the engagement. This is why we have decided not to go about reaching out to the 80% of the lurkers but rather find ways in order for people – lurker or not – to be able to join the community any time they want.

First is the registration process. Dan has created an airtable form that allows us to manage the members that are coming into our website. The registrants will then be vetted and will be invited to the community.

Joe will then welcome them, along with Pamela and Stephen. The newcomers are invited to an onboarding session that will cover the things new members need to know. Afterwards, Joe, Pamela, Stephen, and Preston will take part in the onboarding buddy system, which will help the volunteers to be guided through the community further so that they will be ready to contribute and join a project.
