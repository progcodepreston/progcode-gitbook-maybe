## Ideation {#ideation}

Because of this chaos or constant collaborative energy in the community, we have to be able to open to any forms of ideas, and quelling ideas – shooting ideas down – is the most unproductive thing a staffer can possibly do. We will do everything we can to encourage conversations about ideas, and anything that is counterproductive to that will be grounds for a campaign for a staffer to be removed.
