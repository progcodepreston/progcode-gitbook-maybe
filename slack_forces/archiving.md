## Archiving {#archiving}

Archiving is a high level act of dominance if not done right. This imposes an order from staffers – or anyone – if the buy-in of the channel creator was not acquired before such actions. As such, we go through a long process before archiving, because quelling a channel without any buyin from the creator not only induces a very bad rapport to the creator, but also sends a harsh signal to the community at large and may risk ruining the culture.
