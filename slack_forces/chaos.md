## Chaos {#chaos}

We embrace the chaos of Slack, as it allows us to really see the dynamics of a network in play. Peer to peer communication, collaboration, all happening in channels, DMs, etc.

The  main goal as staffers is to be able to embrace the chaos but at the same time make it manageable. This means we should be able to facilitate if needed, backoff when not. We should not dominate but support, and as staffers, our goal is to find opportunities of success for the members.

This means being able to provide channels of conversation in the right spaces.

Specifically, we need to realize that housekeeping in slack is mainly on shepherding unproductive and destructive talk to avenues that welcome it, such as dumpster-fire.
