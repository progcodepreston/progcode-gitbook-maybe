## Channel Dynamics {#channel-dynamics}

A channel is a form of ownership by the channel creator. The creator has put a stake on the community by creating a channel that s/he is accountable to. We should respect this ownership and not intrued in the process they have set themselves to, we should facilitate collaboration within the channel if asked, or if our offers are accepted.
