## Stimulus {#stimulus}

We as staffers have levers and mechanisms in place to induce stimulus to projects within the network.

### Volunteers {#volunteers}

The influx or any addition of quality development partners is a huge boost to the morale and joy of the app creators and the team behind these applications. It is in our best interest to bring volunteers onto their works to excite them and enjoy their stay in our community.

### Network Effects {#network-effects}

Being able to connect and provide value through the connections we have established within and outside the network.

### Personal Relationships {#personal-relationships}

Having a personal connection with the app creators really drive home the point that we are a ready framework of support, we come from a place of service and have their interest – not our individual interests – at heart. Coming from that place of interest will help flourish the community.
