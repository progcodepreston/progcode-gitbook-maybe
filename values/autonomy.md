## Autonomy {#autonomy}

In the same vein, ProgCode does not and will not interfere with the decisions within applications. The decisions on legal structure, direction, movement, and next steps, is all decided on the part of the app creators, and will not have any unsolicited input from ProgCode. ProgCode comes in a place of service, not dominance.

The services we provide include support frameworks partners can adopt any parts of which they choose, which will make it easier for them to get started. This would include things like templates, planning documents, operating structure, etc.
