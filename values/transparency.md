## Transparency {#transparency}

Transparency is a tool to empower members to really do something for the community. We see transparency as a way to provide access to different parts of the house and allow people to “get their feet wet” and know for themselves how to contribute. We always say that people will contribute however they want to contribute, and they will engage however they want to engage. Being transparent opens up that dialog of engaging and contribution in ways that are truly beautiful.

On the other hand, we recognize the need to have private conversations for private information, and we also use privilege information as a way to empower leaders. We understand that there are information that should not be shared in public, like personal information, trade secrets, and future plans. As such, we are adamant in reinforcing privacy and security if necessary.
