# Values {#values}

ProgCode values, above all else, the idea of

*   Ownership
*   Autonomy
*   Collaboration
*   Non-hierarchy
*   Decentralization
*   Push and Be Pulled
*   Personal relationships
*   Transparency 

Furthermore, we encourage the idea of pushing and pushing changes/efforts, but at the same time have the humility of being pulled back. The staff should have no ego as much as possible, and we encourage being candid and honest to one another. These, of course, should be grounded on the personal relationships we have built with each other. Finally, transparency is such an integral part of the way things are done that it is always in the core of everything we do.
