## Ownership {#ownership}

We fully respect and try to cultivate as much as possible the idea of ownership of individual member, may it be on the code they make or any initiative they decide to take. We respect ownership down to the basic level of ideation, where the idea is brought about into the community and we respect the ideator’s ownership of it, thus we will never set a culture of bringing down other’s ideas. Instead, we see ideas as seed or the most basic level of a member putting a stake into the ProgCode community, and that is something that has to be cultivated and allowed to grow.

On the other end of the spectrum, ProgCode should not and will not have any ownership beyond the goal that it is intended to do. If we go beyond the need to provide a framework of support to the applications within the network, we will then create a reason for us not to become obsolete, which is against the core objective of ProgCode.

As an entity, ProgCode cannot and will not own anything outside the intended purpose of becoming a framework of support. However, staffers should still be able to own projects but it will not and should not be under the ProgCode identity.
