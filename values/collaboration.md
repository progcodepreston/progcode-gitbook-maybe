## Collaboration {#collaboration}

This is where the idea of conduits comes in. As staffers, we are the facilitators of collaboration within and also between projects.

### Members to Projects {#members-to-projects}

This means that we will constantly find ways for individual members to collaborate with app leaders, by constantly engaging them into conversation and find ways for them to be a happy contributing member of the tech community. We want to have an open conversation and outreach to volunteers, and become a positive force that wants to offer opportunities for them to become fulfilled members who are making a huge impact for the progressive movement – through their skills and talent.

### Projects to other projects {#projects-to-other-projects}

It is already a given fact that there are projects that have complementary – sometimes identical – goals and ways to go about problems. ProgCode is not and will not be in the business of forcing any of these projects to merge as it totally violates our view point on autonomy, but rather become an open communication channel and a conduit for opportunities for these projects to collaborate.

### Projects and the network outside {#projects-and-the-network-outside}

The projects within the community serves a bigger purpose, and that is to affect, serve, and make an impact to the world outside. Staffers – through their connections – will find ways to build connections between the projects and civic society.
