## Decentralization {#decentralization}

This may be mis-construed as the same as non-hierarchy but that is not the case here. The idea of decentralization is the delegation of the “centers” of the network across multiple hubs. The structure of the network is a community that has the gravities around applications, and app creators driving their own works within their projects.

Given that the network hubs are the applications, and that members are funneled into the ProgCode ecosystem initially, our best interest is to bring the conversation and action onto the hubs around ProgCode, constantly trying to make the “mass” of ProgCode as small as possible by sending volunteers to the projects, bringing development and activity into those projects.

This highlights the need for ProgCode as an entity to not own any projects other than anything that facilitates the lessening of the ProgCode “mass” and driving energies into different projects. Owning projects dilutes the goal and message of ProgCode.
